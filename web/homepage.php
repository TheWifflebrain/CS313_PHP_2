        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate[b] is a 2018 crossover fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd., 
            and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the fifth installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, 
            succeeding Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: 
            controlling one of various characters, players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out 
            of an arena. It features a wide variety of game modes, including a campaign for single-player and multiplayer versus modes. 
            Ultimate includes every playable character from previous Super Smash Bros. games—ranging from Nintendo's mascots to characters 
            from third-party franchises—and several newcomers, reaching a total of over 70.

            <h3>Ike</h3>
            <p>
                Ike is a fictional character from the Fire Emblem series of video games. More specifically, he is the central protagonist and Lord-class 
                character of the ninth game in the series, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and one of the central characters in Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn.

            <h3>Sheik</h3>
            <p>
                In The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Zelda disguises herself as a surviving member of the Sheikah clan under the name of Sheik. With voice
                muffled and face concealed, as well as wearing a form-fitting blue unitard with the red Sheikah eye in the center, Sheik is unrecognizable as Zelda.
                Sheik plays the lyre and teaches Link new songs to help him on his quest. When Link arrives at the Temple of Time near the end of the game, she uses 
                the Triforce of Wisdom and reverts to Zelda. It is revealed by the character's trophy in the North American translation of Super Smash Bros. Melee 
                that Zelda used her magical skills to change her skin tone, hair length, eye color, and clothing; in the noncanonical officially licensed manga for 
                The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, following changing her appearance, Zelda orders Impa to seal her consciousness away for seven years, so that 
                she may become Sheik and live incognito.[15] Sheik also returned in Hyrule Warriors, using a harp and shortsword in her attacks.
